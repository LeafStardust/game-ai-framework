# Roadmap

> The roadmap tracks active milestones, not release notes. Completed work is summarized; detailed implementation evidence belongs in tests, logs, commits and release documentation.
>
> Balatro uses **one permanent agent and one permanent mechanics/state/execution stack**. Deck/stake strategy is supplied by a replaceable **playbook cartridge** selected from the observed live run.
>
> Production observation is repository-owned, read-only Windows process memory. Production execution is the repository-owned first-party in-process bridge. Hidden future information remains excluded: no RNG-state/seed exploitation and no ordered future draw pile.

## v1.0.0 — Red Deck / White Stake Competence — IN PROGRESS

Goal: turn the completed autonomous stack into a **deliberate, repeatable Red Deck / White Stake player**, not merely an agent capable of finishing a run by chance.

### 1.0A — Blind survival and hand efficiency

- [x] Make clear probability and a feasible remaining clear path the dominant D1 objective, with pace discipline across remaining hands/discards.
- [x] Among similarly safe clear lines, prefer fewer hands and capture unused-hand economy.
- [x] Preserve future hand value explicitly, including retained structure, Steel cards, Blue Seals and other build-relevant held cards.
- [x] Tune discard/recovery behavior around the active clear path rather than isolated hand value.

### 1.0B — Build coherence

- [x] Maintain persistent public build/archetype intent and apply B3–B7 reasoning consistently across D1–D14.
- [x] Make Joker, hand, discard, Planet, consumable and pack decisions reinforce the active build.
- [x] Detect and penalize anti-synergies/conflicts, including a Ride the Bus + Business Card regression case.
- [x] Give useful Negative Jokers explicit slot-free acquisition value.
- [x] Log meaningful build-intent changes and detected conflicts.

### 1.0C — Planet and consumable competence

- [x] Value Planets by expected future hand frequency, marginal level gain, build synergy and feasibility; suppress speculative upgrades such as unsupported early Straight Flush/Neptune lines.
- [x] Align consumable acquisition with use timing and finalize held-consumable use/target thresholds.

### 1.0D — Shop, pack and economy competence

- [ ] Calibrate D3/D8/D9/D10/D11 acquisition, sale, reroll and pack thresholds around survival, build value and economy; keep D12 threshold-free and calibrate D14 shared resource valuation on the same scale.
- [x] Model run-wide voucher value plus reserve/interest breakpoints, including observable voucher-modified caps or thresholds.
- [ ] Keep undiscovered-item acquisition bias bounded so it never overrides survival or build coherence.

### 1.0E — Blind skip/tag strategy

- [ ] Evaluate skip/tag EV against blind reward, lost shop/economy opportunity, build strength, ante and boss preparation.
- [ ] Validate skip/tag behavior with real-run examples before freezing thresholds.

### 1.0F — Acceptance gate

- [ ] Freeze final Red/White D1–D14 thresholds after live tuning.
- [ ] Complete **one unseeded Red Deck / White Stake win** with no manual gameplay input after activation, normal Steam progression preserved, a complete replayable authoritative run log with decision/build rationales, and automatic OFF after the win.

## v1.1–v1.7 — Red Deck stake progression

| Version | Stake | New adaptation focus |
|---|---|---|
| v1.1 | Red | No Small Blind reward money |
| v1.2 | Green | Green Stake score scaling |
| v1.3 | Black | Eternal Joker strategy |
| v1.4 | Blue | Reduced-discard strategy |
| v1.5 | Purple | Purple Stake score scaling |
| v1.6 | Orange | Perishable Joker strategy |
| v1.7 | Gold | Rental Joker strategy and Red Deck all-stakes validation |

Each stake milestone adds only the adaptation required by that stake, retunes the Red Deck playbook as needed, and requires one successful unseeded run.

## v2+ — Additional decks

Planned deck order after Red Deck completion:

1. **Blue Deck — v2.x**
2. **Yellow Deck — v3.x**
3. **Green Deck — v4.x**
4. **Black Deck — v5.x**
